# Real Estate Photos
Loads pictures from a folder onto a layout with a side bar. The side bar has input fields allowing the user to add 
information like price, location and features. When the user is finished it makes that photo with the information into a 
new photo to be used in a slideshow.

## Background
This was a prototype idea to help out someone I knew with a real estate business. They wanted to have a slideshow of images 
running on a TV that would display a house and and overview about it.

## How To
You can put images in the "Assets/Photos" folder. Open the "Master" scene and hit play. You will see input fields on the right 
hand side with Price, location, and features with place holder text. 

**Next/Finish Button:** Will create the new image and place it in the "Assets/NewPhotos" folder.

## About
